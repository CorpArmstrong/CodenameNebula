<P>Miraculous genetic foundation. If there was such this space aliens I would say it's extraterrestrial in origin. If only Dr. Kavanaugh and I had a sample of the specimen when we were working on the OCM things would be so different. 15 years of work on subject and I was never able to figure out why I configure Pikadon-grade nanites in Tantalus' neuron cells. Like it or not, Bob's the boss. I guess that this projects is so secret we will never find out what we were working on...
