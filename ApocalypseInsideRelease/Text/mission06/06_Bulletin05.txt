<P><B>The Dentons' Car</B>
<P>
<P>Exhibit name: Car In The Dentons' Were Assassinated
<P>Danger level: Low
<P>Date of aquisition: 2035
<P>
<P>Notes: A successful eugenic experiment born from the Illuminati's 20th centure smallpox vaccinations, the Dentons' made two killer-babies with DNA of a Superman. The mommy protested against JC's future with Terrorism Limitation Coalition (TLC, now UNATCO). By initiative of Bob Page the Dentons had to be put out of the picture with hundreds of their babies growing in Area 51. The car accident that was staged went impecably smooth, but if the car were ever found it could link to the organization. The police report indicated a car of a similar make in order to cover up the evidence. No one will ever know.
<P>P.S. Blake's old brown suit is attached with the car wreck.
